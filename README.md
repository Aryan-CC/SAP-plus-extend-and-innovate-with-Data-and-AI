# SAP plus extend and innovate

Contoso Retail, Inc. has been selling goods through various retail channels for the past 15 years. They currently have over 200 brick-and-mortar stores but plan to reduce the number of physical locations to 150 in the next year due to declining revenue and various other factors. Of the remaining 150 stores, 35 of them are currently streamlined for an attempted re-branding that happened a few years ago. SAP is the line-of-business application and database for all customer and supply chain information. 

Contoso needs the ability to collect and analyze data from within SAP in order to make the best uniform solution possible.
They want to take control of their supply chain so customers know when and where products are available, and stores are prepared to keep up with demand.

The improved ability to meet customer demand will be accomplished by establishing a 360-degree view of the supply chain. With data analysis and reporting, stores will be able to plan and schedule product deliveries based on customer sentiment and current buying trends.

### Workshop

In this workshop, you will learn how to architect a highly available deployment of SAP on Azure. Throughout the whiteboard design session, you will look at the planning process for SAP on Azure migration and deployment, and how to integrate data and AI solutions to present data and identify trends that can be presented to executives from the SAP HANA database.

At the end of this workshop you will be able to better design and discuss the use of SAP data for collecting and transforming retail data from customers and inventory to predict trends and provide recommendations to customers.
