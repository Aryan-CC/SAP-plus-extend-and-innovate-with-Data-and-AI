# SAP plus extend and innovate with Data and AI student guide

## Abstract and learning objectives

Contoso Retail, Inc. has been facing challenges in modernizing its on-premises SAP landscape in order to better compete in the current marketplace. Among the main challenges are that Contoso has an aging on-premises infrastructure, not capable of running more demanding analytical workloads.  They do not have a disaster recovery environment and limited high-availability provisions. Contoso has found that it is expensive to maintain development and testing environments. They have a lack of full visibility of supply and demand signals across the value chain.  They are also insufficient in their ability to use customer data, precluding the ability to implement targeted advertising. They have determined that they maintain a suboptimal delivery route planning and scheduling.

As a struggling retailer, Contoso has been dealing with significant financial constraints. Given a hard limit of its capital expenditure budget, Contoso has been considering leveraging its operational budget and taking advantage of the pay-as-you-go model offered by Microsoft Azure. 

To remedy these challenges, Contoso has asked you to design and implement a solution that will help them regain the competitive edge by transitioning their SAP landscape to Azure and modernizing it by leveraging Azure services. 

Contoso has determined that to optimize their environment, the following key success criteria must be met.  They would like a highly available SAP landscape with the ability to minimize cost through right-sizing and optimized resource allocation.  They need data integration and analytics capabilities that include the ability to provide a comprehensive view of logistical and operational data, including sensor data from IoT devices in warehouses, stores, and manufacturing plants.  Contoso would like to utilize social media sentiment analytics and personalized marketing.  In addition, they would like to improve delivery route planning and scheduling, leveraging external data feeds that account for such factors as road closures or inclement weather.  They also would like optimized demand forecasting with automatic anomaly detection within their supply chain.

Your primary objective is to provide integration across all data to be used for analysis and reporting, bringing together manufacturing, supply chain, and sales. Your solution should help the customer, represented by the Chief Marketing Officer, Chief Digital Officer, the Chief Data Officer, and the Customer Experience Manager, deliver a 360-degree view of the Contoso's business operations and to optimize them through data analytics. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and Chief Information Officer (CIO) believe that providing this level of customer insights will increase revenue and deliver a competitive advantage to Contoso. 

## Step 1: Review the customer case study 

**Outcome**

Analyze your customer's needs.

Timeframe: 15 minutes

Directions: With all participants in the session, the facilitator/SME presents an overview of the customer case study along with technical tips.

1.  Meet your team members and trainer.

2.  Read all directions for steps 1-3 in the student guide.

3.  As a team, review the following customer case study.

### Customer situation

Contoso Retail, Inc. has been selling goods through various retail channels for the past 15 years. They currently have over 200 brick-and-mortar stores but plan to reduce the number of physical locations to 150 in the next year due to declining revenue and various other factors. Of the remaining 150 stores, 35 of them are currently streamlined for an attempted re-branding that happened a few years ago. 

SAP is the line-of-business application and database for all customer and supply chain information. SAP will manage the customer experience, including finance, inventory, delivery, and customer service.  SAP will be used to integrate with suppliers for re-ordering of products based on demand and sales projections. Sales and Inventory data will be delivered to executives for revenue projections for analysis of trends and potential shifts in demand.

Contoso needs the ability to collect and analyze data from within SAP in order to make the best uniform solution possible. They want to take control of their supply chain, so customers know when and where products are available, and stores are prepared to keep up with demand.

The improved ability to meet customer demand will be accomplished by establishing a 360-degree view of the supply chain. With data analysis and reporting, stores will be able to plan and schedule product deliveries based on customer sentiment and current buying trends. 

Contoso has brought together a group of SAP, Azure, Applications, and Data and AI specialists to design and architect a solution that meets the company's needs. To remediate these shortcomings, Contoso is looking for the ability to combine all sources of data, including:

*   Contoso has sensor data from IoT devices in warehouses, stores, and manufacturing plants they would like to be able to analyze.
*   They would like to utilize social media sentiment analytics for inventory recommendations.
*   Contoso would like to use external feeds with such information as road closures and inclement weather to manage deliveries efficiently.

Contoso wants to take control of their supply chain to ensure that their customers can easily locate and purchase the products they are interested in and that their stores are prepared to keep up with the actual demand. To accomplish this, Contoso will need to establish a 360-degree view of the supply chain, with data analysis and reporting that provides the business with the ability to address manufacturing and service issues, plan, and schedule deliveries of products according to forecasted needs, and gauge these needs based on customer sentiment and up-to-date buying trends.

As part of its business plan, Contoso is looking to implement the following objectives:

*   They would like to provision compute and storage resources which capacity exceeds what's currently supported by the aging on-premises infrastructure hosting the existing SAP landscape.  
*   Contoso has invested in SAP S/4HANA for all ERP, finance, customer experience and CRM, and supply chain management solutions.
*   Contoso wants to increase resiliency by including full-fledged high-availability provisions and setting up a disaster recovery site.
*   They want to minimize cost of development and testing environments.
*   Whenever possible, Contoso would like to simplify the operational model by leveraging managed services.
*   Contoso would like to enhance delivery route planning and scheduling by referencing external data feeds that account for such factors as road closures or inclement weather.
*   They would like to integrate the SAP-resident data with disparate data sources, including Twitter feeds and IoT devices.
*   Contoso wants to automate collection, pre-processing, and analytics of streaming data.
*   They would like to consolidate online and in-store data to facilitate targeted advertising tailored towards individual customers.
*   Contoso wants to improve online customer experience by leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies such as natural language understanding.

### Customer needs

1.  Contoso wants to minimize the cost by right sizing the SAP landscape implementation and optimize the use of compute resources.

2. They would like to leverage Azure services to extend and innovate data collection and analysis (including sensor data from IoT devices, web site and app telemetry, as well as social networking feeds reflecting customer behavior, sentiment, and purchasing patterns).

3. Contoso would like to fine-tune inventory and staff management to ensure all channels are working with the optimal resource allocation according to predicted demands.

4. Contoso wants to streamline remediation of manufacturing service issues and enhance available-to-promise retail capabilities.

5. They would also like to minimize the operational overhead within their current processes.

### Customer objections

1.  We currently have all the data we need, why do we need to do anything else?

2.  We've spent a lot of money and time building out the systems we have, why should we start over in Azure rather than upgrade our existing hardware?

3.  How will this solution help us to create a better process for getting our products from the manufacturing to the warehouses and then to the stores any quicker? Our staff is already working overtime and trucks won't be able to physically drive any faster while maintaining safety standards. 

4.  How can we ensure the privacy of our customers is sufficiently protected if we pursue targeted advertising by leveraging Azure services?

### Infographic for common scenarios

SAP on Azure provides many potential scenarios and benefits that are shown in this illustration.
