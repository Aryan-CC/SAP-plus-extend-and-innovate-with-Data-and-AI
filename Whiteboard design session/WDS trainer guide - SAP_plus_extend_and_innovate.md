## Before the whiteboard design session: How to prepare

Before conducting your first whiteboard design session:

- Read the Student guide (including the case study) and Trainer guide.

- Become familiar with all key points and activities.

- Plan the point you want to stress, which questions you want to drive, transitions, and be ready to answer questions.

- Prior to the whiteboard design session, discuss the case study to pick up more ideas.

- Make notes for later.

## During the whiteboard design session: Tips for an effective whiteboard design session

**Refer to the Trainer guide** to stay on track and observe the timings.

**Do not expect to memorize every detail** of the whiteboard design session.

When participants are doing activities, you can **look ahead to refresh your memory**.

- **Adjust activity and whiteboard design session pace** as needed to allow time for presenting, feedback, and sharing.

- **Add examples, points, and stories** from your own experience. Think about stories you can share that help you make your points clearly and effectively.

- **Consider creating a "parking lot"** to record issues or questions raised that are outside the scope of the whiteboard design session or can be answered later. Decide how you will address these issues, so you can acknowledge them without being derailed by them.

***Have fun**! Encourage participants to have fun and share!*

**Involve your participants**. Talk and share your knowledge but always involve your participants, even while you are the one speaking.

**Ask questions** and get them to share to fully involve your group in the learning process.

**Ask first**, whenever possible. Before launching into a topic, learn your audience's opinions about it and experiences with it. Asking first enables you to assess their level of knowledge and experience and leaves them more open to what you are presenting.

**Wait for responses**. If you ask a question such as, "What's your experience with (fill in the blank)?" then wait. Do not be afraid of a little silence. If you leap into the silence, your participants will feel you are not serious about involving them and will become passive. Give participants a chance to think, and if no one answers, patiently ask again. You will usually get a response.

# SAP plus extend and innovate student guide

## Abstract and learning objectives

Contoso Retail processes and distributes food to supermarkets and other small-to-medium sized companies.  Generous credit terms based on relationships instead of data analytics has put the company in financial difficulty.  They have challenges identifying customers’ payment behaviors and notifying customers when they are behind on invoice payments.  The accounting department uses manual processes to identify delinquent accounts making the accounts receivable (AR) management time consuming.  Also, lenders and have capped CFD’s line of credit and increased the interest rate until they can lower their AR balance and be able to predict near term future cash flow.

In this whiteboard design session, you will work in a group to design the data pipeline PoC that could support the needs of Contoso Retail.

At the end of this workshop, you’ll have the knowledge necessary to build a data pipeline that will ingest SAP and Cosmos DB data into a common Azure Synapse data warehouse.  You will be able analyze AR and sales data to deliver a 360-degree view of customers’ accounts.  Using Power BI and Power Automate, you will be able to optimize company operations through data analytics and process automation.


## Step 1: Review the customer case study 

**Outcome**

Analyze your customer's needs.

Timeframe: 15 minutes

Directions:  With all participants in the session, the facilitator/SME presents an overview of the customer case study along with technical tips.

1. Meet your team members and trainer.

2. Read all directions for steps 1-3 in the student guide.

3. As a team, review the following customer case study.

### Customer situation

Contoso Food Distribution (CFD), Inc., subsidiary of Contoso Retail Inc., has been selling goods through various channels for the past 15 years. Their primary customer segments are supermarkets, retail chains, and small- to mid-size enterprise stores.  The business has been built on great customer service and relationships.  They have been facing recent challenges leveraging their on-premises SAP and Azure Cosmos DB investments to manage their AR and customers’ accounts.

Food processing and distribution has small profit margins and large transaction volume.  Inventory is perishable and needs to be delivered quickly.  CFD's CEO, Jan Smith, has chosen to deliver product first and manage account details later.  Unfortunately, CFD is having issues with high accounts receivables and rising inventory finance costs.  Mari Stephens, the CFO, is frustrated CFD operational credit line is being capped and the interest rate increased until they can lower their accounts receivable balances and predict their future cash flow is healthy.  This small interest expense increase is a problem given the industry’s thin profit margins.

The accounting department director, Sarah Smith, says customer AR management has always been a problem.  The AR and sales data is spread across different systems. Manually merging and analyzing the data sources is time consuming and error prone.  Accounting runs reports from the two different systems and data is exported to spreadsheets.

![The current process shows Excel spreadsheets exported and merged.](media/contoso-current-process.png "Contoso Current Process")

By the time a problem is identified, it becomes more difficult to correct.  Valuable constrained accounting resources are manually contacting delinquent accounts weeks after the problem has started making it more difficult to correct.  Some existing customers are habitually late payers and new accounts drift into this problem behavior.

Contoso needs cash now and is considering selling some of its accounts receivables to outside debt collection agencies for a short-term cash infusion and is thinking about enforcing late payment fees for customers with balances beyond 50 days.  This type of option would have a positive cash flow, but might lead to weakening customer relationships and sales reductions.  Correcting customer payment behavior problems early is critical. The invoice late payment fees are substantial and could help manage customer paying behaviors. Also, the account managers believe it would be useful to notify customers when they are approaching an invoice due date.

Large supermarkets and retail chains, hold the upper hand in negotiations due to their large purchasing power and number of competing product suppliers.  Generous credit limits and payment terms are offered by Contoso to entice customers in exchange for high sales volume. The finance department would like the ability to use data analytics to determine a consistent amount of customer credit based on sales data and payment history.  Finance and accounting want to identify delinquent accounts easily and adjust the amount of credit offered based on payment behaviors.

Timely and accurate AR and sales reports are required to support difficult decisions, like changing a customer from credit to cash only basis. Downgrading a customer’s credit may result in reduced sales but would improve the organization’s overall financial health.  Customer AR and sales data must be correlated and reviewed when these account decisions are made.

Contoso is looking for the ability to integrate relevant sources of data into a central data warehouse.  They are looking forward to analytic and automation tools.  For example, the accounting department would like to be notified by email quickly when customer AR balances reach certain payment delinquency thresholds.  These types of automated alerts would reduce the lag between problem discovery and mitigation.

The accounting department has asked IT for assistance with creating workflows and reports to assist with the AR reporting problem in the past.  Sarah thinks IT did a great job creating payment tracking system, which utilizes Azure Cosmos DB.  Unfortunately, IT resources are constrained, and they do not have the necessary time to develop a new system from the ground up.  Sarah says accounting feels like they are on their own when it comes reporting and processes.  They like the independence because, “they know the data and can develop Excel reports quickly.”  She hates the manual time-consuming data merging and the inability to share reports easily. The process is so time consuming, the data becomes stale quickly. The accounting department would like a self-service reporting solution.  Small report configuration changes need to happen quickly without having to wait weeks or months for the IT department to respond.  Guy Information, the CIO, is concerned about the shadow accounting processes created previously and reminded Sarah about how difficult it was to identify and share the correct AR balance data.  Duplicate spreadsheets became a real problem.  IT and Accounting want to make sure there is proper governance and a single source of truth for critical data.

The Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Chief Information Officer (CIO), and accounting department are looking for a comprehensive solution to the challenges described above.

### Customer needs

1. Contoso wants to focus on their customers’ payment behavior.  The want to extend credit to the customers with responsible payment history.  Slow-paying customers should be identified as candidates for cash-only sales, have reduced credit lines, and be managed more closely.

2. The accounting staff needs to identify and collect on invoices at 30, 50, 70 days past due. They need an automated data workflow that updates a centralized dashboard.

3. They would like to leverage their existing investment in Azure.  The solution should extend and innovate data integration and analysis.

4. Predictive analytics will provide the ability forecast cash flows based on customer payment history and sales orders. Contoso would like to fine-tune staff management to ensure optimal resource allocation according to customer payment predictions. The accounting staff will focus on high risk accounts to maximize payments.

5. They would also like to minimize the operational overhead within their current processes.  The accounting and IT department would like a low-code self-service approach to reporting and automated workflows.

### Customer objections

1. How will this solution help us to create a better process for visualizing and discovering AR balance problems and collecting payments from our customers?

2. Our staff is already working overtime we don’t want staff to be distracted by a new process and reviewing large reports with tons of data. The accounting and finance departments want a centralized system to create dashboards, share critical data, and automate repetitive manual tasks.  They do not have months to learn a new tool or wait for IT to create reports them.

3. Predicting cash flows seems very appealing.  We have heard that creating a machine learning model takes a month to build and another 2-3 months to operationalize to be useable from our production systems.  Is this true?

4. Management does not want to spend large amounts of money on IT hardware they have to manage on-premises.

## Preferred solution  

_High-level architecture_

The proposed solutions take advantage of a wide range of Azure services in order to enhance the agility, resiliency, and resiliency of the customer's SAP landscape, as well as to deliver additional data integration capabilities. In particular, it provides the following functionality:

- Support for in-region and cross-region redundancy, providing high availability and disaster recovery capabilities.
- A development and test environment, where costs can be minimized through an optimal resource sizing and snoozing.
- Hot and cold paths for ingesting, processing, and storing data generated by IoT devices, implemented by using Azure IoT Intelligent Edge.
- Hot and cold paths for ingesting, processing, and storing data generated by social media, implemented by a range of native Azure services.
- Integration with Azure Machine Learning and Azure Cognitive Services.
- Business integration that leverages Azure Logic Apps.

  ![This is a diagram illustrating the preferred solution for extending data and AI into an SAP architecture.](media/azure-data-pipeline-social-media.png 'Diagram of the Preferred solution') 

_Data ingestion and integration_


_Data transformation and processing_

1. How would you approach the need for additional analysis of data originating from SAP and non-SAP data sources?
   
   You have the option of combining SAP and non-SAP data sources for additional transformation and processing. This might involve long-running batch jobs to filter, aggregate, and prepare data for further analysis. Processing options include U-SQL jobs in Azure Data Lake Analytics, Hive, Pig, and custom Map/Reduce jobs in an HDInsight cluster, or Java, Scala, and Python programs in a Synapse Analytics Spark cluster. 
   
2. Which Azure services would you use to implement the corresponding functionality?
      
   It is also possible to use Azure Data Factory to extract data from SAP HANA and SAP Business Warehouse (BW) into Azure data stores, such as Azure Blob Storage and Azure Data Lake to facilitate implementation of advanced analytics with Azure Synapse Analytics. 

    ![Diagram illustrating an Azure data pipeline that leverages SAP and non-SAP data sources.](media/azure-data-pipeline-with-sap-sources.png 'Azure data pipeline that leverages the preferred solution') 

_Data analytics_

1. How would you analyze the data to facilitate identifying relevant information?
   
   The solution prepares data for analysis and then serves the processed data in a structured format that can be queried using analytical tools. The analytical data store used to serve these queries can be a relational data warehouse, which is part of the existing business intelligence solution. Alternatively, the data could be presented through a low-latency NoSQL technology such as HBase, or an interactive Hive database that provides a metadata abstraction over data files in the distributed data store.

    Azure Synapse Analytics provides a managed service for large-scale, cloud-based data warehousing. Azure Synapse Analytics Spark tools are optimized for analyzing and transforming data for presentation. This analysis could reference data stored in Azure Cosmos DB. For example, Azure Synapse Link for Azure Cosmos DB enables you to run near real-time analytics over operational data in Azure Cosmos DB. 

2. What Azure services would allow Contoso to further enrich the data by leveraging technologies such as artificial intelligence?

      To further enrich your data, you can combine data from your SAP databases with other systems pooled into Azure Data Lake. With Azure Synapse Analytics and Power BI dashboards, you are able to monitor supplier status, track inbound materials flows, and oversee logistics in real time. This also allows you to overlay operating status with external data such as road closures or inclement weather to identify potential problems before they might impact production schedules or customer deliveries. Combining market and demand data with your resource planning systems, you can further improve
      business forecasting.

      Another option that helps your further innovate the way you manage business data is Azure Anomaly Detector, which is part of Azure Cognitive Services. Anomaly Detector allows you to evaluate transactions, represented by time series data, across your entire SAP landscape in order to detect potential issues before they might have a negative impact. Based on incoming telemetry sources, the Anomaly Detector solution detects if there is a sudden change in creation or update processes. The detection algorithm can detect these issues automatically, in real time, and notify you in order to initiate a corrective action.

      For example, Contoso could use Anomaly Detector to monitor changes to the Master Data Management (MDM) space, hosting objects representing business entities such as customers and business partners to detect and, optionally, remediate any unusual patterns. Similarly, Contoso could leverage Anomaly Detector to detect a sudden increase in online purchases of a particular product on its e‑commerce website. This would allow them to take immediate actions to ensure product availability. 

      Contoso could implement Anomaly Detector with native Azure services composing decoupled business logic and the presentation layers. These services include: 

      - An Azure web app, which forms the presentation layer. Its purpose is to allow users to call the anomaly-detection service by using the prepared time-series data. The choice of Azure Web App Service gives Contoso's developers the option to work in their preferred language, including .NET, .NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, or Python. In addition, the application endpoint can be protected by leveraging Azure Active Directory for authentication and authorization.
      - Two Azure function apps, which host all business-logic functionality. The first is used to connect to Azure Application Insights and capture SAP telemetry, such as customer or business-partner processes that are target of anomaly detection. This function app transforms target data into JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format with time-series sub formatting. The second function app captures the precompiled time-series data from the first function app, makes a call to the Anomaly Detector service, and then retrieves the result. At that point, the web app presentation layer displays the results in a graph format. 
      - Application Insights, which stores all SAP log data. This log data is captured from various business processes, including Customer Master Data creation, Business Partner Creation and updates, and batch program logs. These logs serve as the source for anomaly detection.
      - Azure Anomaly Detector, which exposes API to detect and returns all anomaly points based on time-series data sent by the function app. It is possible to interact with Anomaly Detector either by directly using the HTTP REST API or by relying on client SDK.  

      ![Diagram illustrating an Anomaly Detector solution.](media/sap-extend-innovate-anomaly-detector.png 'Anomaly Detector architecture')

_Personalized marketing_ 

1. How would you improve personalized marketing for Contoso customers?
   
    Personalized marketing focuses on targeting marketing initiatives and messaging to specific individuals that are either current or prospective customers. For this approach to be effective, Contoso needs to have access to customers' data and employ data analysis and artificial intelligence.

2. Which Azure services would allow you to enhance personalized marketing experience for Contoso customers?
   
    Furthermore, SAP applications can leverage Azure Cognitive Services for a number of purposes, including face recognition, text recognition, and natural language understanding. By deploying Cognitive Services, SAP will be able to analyze information closer to the physical world where the data resides and deliver real-time insights and immersive experiences that are highly responsive and contextually aware. For example, SAP Conversational AI can be implemented in combination with Azure bot channels to enhance conversational experience for online customers, including the ability to communicate via Microsoft Teams.

### Customer Needs

1. They would like to leverage Azure services to extend and innovate data collection and analysis (including sensor data from IoT devices, web site and app telemetry, as well as social networking feeds reflecting customer behavior, sentiment, and purchasing patterns).

    The proposed solutions take advantage of a wide range of Azure services in order to enhance data integration capabilities. In particular, it provides the following functionality:

    By combining and correlating data from multiple sources, such as social SAP and Azure Cosmos DB.

2. They would also like to minimize the operational overhead within their current processes.

    The solution will help Contoso accomplish this objective by improving operational efficiency. This means having trucks that are fully loaded with the correct products and warehouses that are staffed with the personnel best equipped to handle the task at hand. Contoso will use for this purpose predictive analytics that take into account historical data and combine it with Azure AI and ML services to derive the most likely future outcome.

### Checklist of preferred objection handling

1.  We currently have all the data we need, why do we need to do anything else?

    The traditional approach to data integration is no longer sufficient in the modern marketplace. Retailers can now derive meaningful benefits from end-to-end visibility of supply and demand signals across the value chain. 
 
    In parallel, retailers could leverage external data that represents external conditions in order to evaluate how they may affect local demand patterns. The ability to account for external data such as breaking news, weather, or sporting events can help detect and align to shifts in customer demand within hours. Predictive intelligence provided by Microsoft and SAP analytics tools, AI and machine learning models facilitate implementing such solutions, resulting in optimized procurement cycles, minimizing waste, and maximizing profits.

    Similarly, companies can use Azure analytics and Power BI dashboards to monitor supplier status, inbound materials flows and logistics in real time. Through Azure, they can overlay operating status with external data such as road closures or inclement weather to predict problems before they can impact production schedules or customer deliveries. 

    By combining SAP- and Azure-based analytics, it becomes easier to uncover sales trends and customer preferences, resulting in optimized production targets and increased revenues. By expediting planning cycles in coordination with supplier networks and logistics providers, retailers can get products to market faster and deliver tailored products at scale. 

    In addition, retailers can leverage new sources of customer and market data such as social network postings or review sites from outside the organization. This provides even deeper understanding of customers buying patterns and helps track their changes in real time. Such data can be ingested, aggregated, and analyzed by leveraging Azure AI and ML models to predict what offers and experiences will have the most significant impact. At the same time, availability of such data helps build highly accurate and granular profiles for each customer to understand their unique interests and buying patterns. This, in turn, makes it more likely to be able to effectively capture customers' attention, improving their satisfaction and the likelihood of making an actual purchase. 

    Similarly, in the manufacturing scenarios, companies like Contoso will benefit from transitioning to the connected factory paradigm. Modern systems that carry out manufacturing tasks are equipped with smart sensors and controls that directly integrate them with the Internet-connected world. These connected assets can communicate their status as well as receive and process digital input, offering new ways to monitor and automate production lines. Device signals can report equipment health and maintenance needs or help identify efficiency problems either at the individual machine level or in the interactions between machines over an end-to-end production workflow. By incorporating this operational data with existing IT systems and line-of-business applications, manufacturers gain an integrated view of the production landscape and fine-grained control over the physical processes that determine factory performance.

    Sensor-equipped smart machines considerably simplify predictive maintenance and servicing, which minimize operational failures and the corresponding lost productivity. They also provide manufacturers with the ability to track real-time status of their environment, which helps detect anomalous behavior patterns. Tools such as Microsoft Power BI help create operator dashboards that automatically refresh at scheduled intervals, delivering an easy-to-analyze overview of up-to-date utilization and efficiency levels. 

    Combining business data with device telemetry and operational data can significantly increase production efficiency and flexibility, providing an integrated view of operations and improving control over physical production processes. Azure AI and ML solutions help build autonomous workflows that reduce human intervention while improving quality and performance.

2.  We've spent a lot of money and time building out the systems we have, why should we start over in Azure rather than upgrade our existing hardware?

    While it is possible to leverage Azure services in hybrid scenarios with your on-premises SAP landscape, by migrating it to Azure you will be able to fully realize the benefits that the cloud environment has to offer. These benefits go beyond increased agility, resiliency, and scalability, resulting also in meaningful cost savings. A Forrester study published in 2019 found that organizations which migrate SAP to Azure can expect more than a 100% return on investment within 3 years. According to the same study, by the second year, organizations will typically be able to reduce staff required to manage SAP infrastructure by 50% and accelerate SAP releases by 100% due to the ability to rapidly provision test environments. Effectively, organizations can accelerate development cycles, run test marketing campaigns, and validate new product opportunities much faster, greatly reducing time to market. Similarly, financial, and human resources previously dedicated to IT overhead can be allocated to pursuing product and business innovation and new market growth initiatives.

    Azure is SAP certified to run your mission-critical SAP applications. It offers is the industry's most performant and scalable SAP cloud infrastructure, including 25+ configurations that span virtual machines and purpose-built bare metal instances with memory ranging from 192GB to 24TB, in more regions than any other public cloud provider. You also benefit from Azure security services and the industry's largest compliance portfolio for workloads in the cloud and on-premises. 

    In addition, Azure facilitates innovation, with a wide range of services that support different data ingestion, integration, transformation, processing, and visualization services. Your new solution will not only leverage the data that is currently in place, but you will be able to further enrich it by taking advantage of such functionality as cloud-native machine learning and artificial intelligence, including virtual and augmented reality, image recognition, and natural language processing. 

3.  How will this solution help us to create a better process for getting our products from the manufacturing to the warehouses and then to the stores any quicker? Our staff is already working overtime and trucks won't be able to physically drive any faster while maintaining safety standards. 

    The solution will help Contoso with optimizing this process. The objective is to improve efficiency rather than increasing speed or the amount of effort. This means having trucks that are fully loaded with the correct products and warehouses that are staffed with the staff best equipped to handle the task at hand. To accomplish this, you will take advantage of predictive analytics that take into account historical data and combine it with Azure AI and ML services to derive the most likely future outcome. You will also benefit from the availability of external data, such as road closures or inclement weather to identify potential problems before they might impact production schedules or customer deliveries. 

4.  How can we ensure the privacy of our customers is sufficiently protected if we pursue targeted advertising by leveraging Azure services?

    Microsoft fully understands that its customers need to comply with their national, regional, and industry-specific requirements and offers full transparency regarding provisions it offers in this area. These provisions include strict standards regarding the privacy and protection of customer data.
